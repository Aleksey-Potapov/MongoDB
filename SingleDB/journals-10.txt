       abstracts:        "Upcoming statutory UK government guidance for keeping children safe in education reflects the use of social media, which is one of the most common activities undertaken by young people. This study explores how and why young people are using social networking sites (SNS) and whether there are age or gender differences. A key feature of the study was that the research was built around the views and interests of young people and their advice was sought at each point of the four phase methodological process. The study finds significant gender and age differences related to how young people use SNS. An unexpected but significant finding relates to young people’s perception of SNS and how closely it is associated to their offline lives. By understanding that a large proportion of young people perceive SNS as being different to their offline lives, this study provides a new area of focus in order to effectively support young people online.",

       abstracts:        "The importance of social media for today’s youth often elicits teachers to explore educational use of these media. However, many teachers appear to struggle with the tension between possible pedagogical use and the tempting distraction of this technology. The current literature review aims to present a synthesis of conditions and outcomes relevant for a well-considered, evidence-based use of social media, and teacher professional development. A conceptual model consisting of intended curriculum (school level), implemented curriculum (teacher level) and attained curriculum (student level) guided the research questions. The review included 271 articles, which were analysed with framework synthesis. Ambiguous results and poor quality of studies often hindered clear statements about conditions and outcomes regarding social media in the classroom. Nonetheless, reported factors include school culture, attitude towards social media, support, teacher professional development, learning goals and a clear position in the curriculum. Considerations and advice for educational practice were formulated.",

       abstracts:       "This article is devoted to a thirteenth-century Latin text on how to construct, set up, and use a version of the so-called armillary instrument (instrumentum armillarum), which was first described in Ptolemy’s Almagest as a tool for measuring ecliptic coordinates. Written in 1264 by Guillaume des Moustiers, bishop of Laon, this hitherto unstudied Tractatus super armillas survives in a single manuscript, where it is accompanied by a copious set of glosses. The text and its glosses jointly offer an unusually detailed account of the instrument’s material aspects and methods of assembly. In addition, they reflect a keen awareness of the potential sources of error that may arise in the context of astronomical observation, while making suggestions on how these errors may be minimized or avoided. The Tractatus super armillas accordingly is a valuable source on the observational side of medieval European astronomy, which has often been minimized in modern historical accounts.",

It provides proofs of several conjectures and new generalizations of the classical theory, with applications to the prime numbers and polynomials.A third part introduces the algebra of rings and fields in relation to the theory the polynomials and Galois’s theory, which are applied to the resolution of algebraic equations. The classical theorems are extended to polynomials and to the complex field. Numerical examples and approximately 50 exercises with proofs illustrate the main topics.",

The authors explain how, when, where and why certain activities, methods and measures need to be taken. The rice rotation system and the various stages of the production line are comprehensively and correlatively dealt with. The authors see the need for researchers and rice producers to collaborate and have a long term focus and plan of production, to enable the desired product to be attained. For example, if a good quality milling, high yielding rice type is needed, the various factors leading to achieving such a product must be holistically research into and applied in a multidisciplinary manner. Addressing each parameter, in isolation, may end up with the yield being good but the milling quality very poor, or the other way round.",
