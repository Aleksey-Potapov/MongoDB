This study explores how and why young people are using social networking sites (SNS) and whether there are age or gender differences. A key feature of the study was that the research was built around the views and interests of young people and their advice was sought at each point of the four phase methodological process. The study finds significant gender and age differences related to how young people use SNS. An unexpected but significant finding relates to young people’s perception of SNS and how closely it is associated to their offline lives. By understanding that a large proportion of young people perceive SNS as being different to their offline lives, this study provides a new area of focus in order to effectively support young people online.",
